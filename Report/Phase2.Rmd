# Background [1-2 pages]
- Describe the background of the project
- Aims of the analysis
- Specific question(s) you were asked to answer in the Detailed Analysis



# Data Description [1-2 pages]
- State the types of data in the dataset(s) and the structure of the dataset(s). Are the data nu- merical, categorical, or both? Time series? Coordinates? Diagnostic categories? This does NOT need to be an exhaustive list of every variable, just a few comments on the overall types.

- Specifically state the attributes of any variables that are used in the Detailed Analysis, in partic- ular for any categorical variables explain the meaning of their categories

- State how complete the dataset(s) are (i.e.how many missing, any structure to the missing data, whether there are errors in the data)

A large predictor set of health determinants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2015–2016 database was used to predict adults’ scores on a validated instrument to screen for the presence and severity of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]). After model training, the relative influence of individual predictors on depression scores was stratified and analyzed. Model prediction performance was determined by prediction error metrics.
